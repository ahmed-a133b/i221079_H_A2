 • Invalid certificate test: forged/self-signed/expired certs → BAD
 CERT.
 • Tampering test: flip a bit in ct → recomputed digest/signature fails → SIG
 • Replay test: resend old seqno → REPLAY.
 FAIL.
 
• Non-repudiation: export transcript & SessionReceipt; show offline verification:
 1. Verify each message: recompute SHA-256 digest; verify RSA signature.
 2. Verify receipt: verify RSA signature over TranscriptHash.
 3. Show that any edit breaks verification.
